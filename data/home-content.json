      "description": "I am a Lecturer (US equivalent: Assistant Professor) in Medical Robotics in the Department of Bioengineering and a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the I-X initiative at Imperial College London. I am the Director of the Multi-Scale Embodied Intelligence Laboratory. I have been an honorary researcher in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London. Before joining Imperial, I was a Lecturer in the Department of Engineering Mathematics at the University of Bristol, affiliated with the Bristol Robotics Laboratory. I earned her Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computing and her MRes degree from the Department of Surgery and Cancer at Imperial College London. I have cross-disciplinary interests in robotics, biomedicine, and AI. Overall, we have published more than 70 papers in top-tier peer-reviewed engineering and medical imaging journals and conference proceedings."
